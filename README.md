# Identifying-CriticalPrototypicalVectors-in-Prototype-basedArchitectures

This repository provides codes implemented for identifying critical prototypical vectors in prototype-based architectures. The experiments conducted are related to the paper titled: "A Survey of Interpretation Methods for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"

This code package was based upon ProtoPNet from https://github.com/cfchen-duke/ProtoPNet.
